# P2P-Tutoring-Application
The web application allows users to create an account, enter their information, and login, bringing them to a homepage where students can view announcements and a calendar with tutoring dates. It uses a cosine similarity matching algorithm that retrieves information from a user database (firebase) and finds the best match for all peers and tutors.
